Hello, World! I am Shengran Hu (胡圣然). I am a PhD student at University of British Columbia, advised by <a href="http://jeffclune.com/">Dr. Jeff Clune</a>. I am currently interning at <a href="https://sakana.ai/">Sakana AI</a> as a research scientist. I am interested in developing open-ended AI systems that emerge through meta-learning or are capable of self-evolution, leveraging recent advances in Foundation Models.
